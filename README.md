Portfolio for Emerging Sys Architecture and Technology class

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
The pwmled2 project was an introductory program that taught me the fundamentals of using C programming to interface with the Launchpad technology. The program blinked two LEDs on the Launchapd board

The artifacts for this 
## What did you do particularly well?
I did 
## Where could you improve?
I could have done better at getting assistance for issues I encountered with the programming aspects. I had some technical difficulties and parts I struggled to comprehend, so getting assistance would have gone a long way.
## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Code Composer Studio and C Programming are tools that am able to include in my support network. 
## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Creating diagrams for the state machines and task schedulers are great skills that I can use for other projects that are assisted by visuals. 

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using best practice coding techniques helped keep the code in shape, while some of my creative skills for the diagram components were helpful as well.
